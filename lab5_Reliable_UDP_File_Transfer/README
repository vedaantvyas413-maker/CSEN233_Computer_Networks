Used AI to help with approach or errors, did not copy code.

FILES: 

client.c: UDP client implementing the stop-and-wait rdt3.0 protocol. Reads a file, breaks it into packets (≤10 bytes each), adds checksum and sequence number, and reliably transfers data to the server over UDP.

server.c: UDP server implementing the stop-and-wait rdt3.0 protocol. Receives packets from the client, verifies checksum and sequence number, sends ACKs, and reconstructs the file.

test.dat: 300-byte test input file used for transfer testing. This file is sent from the client to the server.

out_test.dat: Output file generated by the server using the rdt transfer.This file is created when the server is run with an output file name argument and is not included initially in the repository. After a successful transfer, this file should match test.dat.

run1.png: Screenshot showing first sample run, at the end of the screenshot there is a file comparison to show the file got copied over correctly

run2.png: Screenshot showing second sample run, at the end of the screenshot there is a file comparison to show the file got copied over correctly. This screenshot also shows the files before the run

PLEASE ZOOM INTO SCREENSHOTS. These screenshots were the only way I could capture full runs.
