Used AI to help write shell script to run programs, did not copy code.

client.c: TCP client that connects to the server, requests a file by name, and saves the received bytes.

server_seq.c: Sequential TCP server that handles one client at a time, serving the requested file.

server_thread.c: Concurrent TCP server that spawns a thread per client to serve requested files in parallel.

test_seq.dat. File used to test the sequential (non-threaded) TCP server. The file is requested by the client and downloaded into a new file on the client side to verify that the client–server file transfer worked correctly and that the received file is not the same as the original. When run, a separate file staring with "received_" is created.

test_thread_1.dat, test_thread_2.dat: Respectively, these files are used to test the concurrent (threaded) TCP server. Each file is requested by a different client at the same time, demonstrating that the server can handle multiple client connections concurrently, with both clients connected to the same server instance.
